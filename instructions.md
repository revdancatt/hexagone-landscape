## Keypresses

'h' - toggle high resolution  
's' - save PNG file  

## Printing

Print size is 4:5 ration

High-res will output at 6,553 x 8,192. At 300dpi it should print at...

Print 2184" x 27.3" at 300dpi
Print 55.47cm x 69.3cm  at 300dpi


Add `?forceWidth=xxxx` where xxxx is the pixels size you want. For example to print at 100cm high, the width would need to be 80cm. 80cm in inches is 31.5" at 300dpi = 9,450 pixels width. So using `?forceWidth=9450` and downloading will give you an PNG large enough to be safely printed at 1 meter height.
