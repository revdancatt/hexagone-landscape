## About

An undulating (sometimes) landscape made up of hexagons (or "Hexagones" laying in wait) to celebrate the first birthday of fxhash. Written at the last minute the weekend before the birthday week.

A simpler 16 colour version of this project was originally coded on an Atari ST 512, about 32 years ago, figured it was time to update it.
